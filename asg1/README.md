Click on 'New Year!' to render my drawing

Added in an option to select opacity
Added in another canvas to display the selected color when updated so you don't have to click on the canvas to see what color you made.
Embedded css to display things next to each other rather than on a newline.
Added a black background for the selected color canvas to see the contrast better.
